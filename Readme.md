## 🚀 Getting started

### Running in development

- npm i -g concurrently ts-node

For the backend

> cd into server.

> npm install

> npm run dev

For the frontend

> cd into client.

> npm install

> npm run dev

For both:

> npm run dev ( in root directory )

Note:

- Incase you want a dummy server to test sniffing as shown in [visual demonstration of how to use](https://github.com/idodav/sharkio#visual-demonstration-how-to-run-the-application), then run the follwoing command:
- `npm run demo` ( in root directory )

### Running in production - using Docker

Run whole project:

- `docker-compose up`
- NOTE: use ports 5550-5560 as proxies, make sure they are available.

Run backend/frontend only:

- `cd` to relevent folder
- build the Docker image: `npm run docker:build`
- run the app: `npm run docker:run`
