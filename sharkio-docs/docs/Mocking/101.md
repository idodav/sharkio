## What is API Mocking?

API Mocking is the process of simulating an API response. This is useful for testing and development purposes.

## How to Mock an API with Sharkio

To mock an API, you need to create a new proxy in the Sharkio dashboard. You can do this by following the steps here: [Creating a Proxy](/docs/Proxing/Proxy%20to%20a%20remote%20server).
When all is set up, you can start mocking the API by clicking on the "Mocks" tab in the sidebar. Then, click on the "Add Mock" button.
When a mock is active, all requests to the specified endpoint will be responded to with the mock response.
