# API Proxing 101

Sharkio is a powerful API development tool that allows you to proxy, debug, mock and test your APIs.

---

### What is API Proxing?

A client sends a request to a proxy server, which then forwards it to the origin server. When the origin server replies to the proxy server, the proxy server sends the response to the client.

### Why use API Proxing?

API Proxing is a powerful tool that allows you to intercept and modify network requests. It is a great way to debug, mock and test your APIs.

### How we do it?

Every time you create a new proxy, we generate a unique domain for you. You can use this domain to redirect your traffic to your proxy. All traffic will be recorded and proxied to the target URL you specified in the previous step. You can then use the dashboard to debug, mock and test your APIs.
